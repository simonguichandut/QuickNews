This is a simple python script that gets the main headlines from a short list of online newspapers: [La Presse](https://www.lapresse.ca), [Le Devoir](https://www.lapresse.ca). It should be simple enough to add others by inspecting the html contents of their homepage.

Simply run:
>Â python news.py

Or add `alias news="python [path-to-QuickNews]/news.py"` to `.bash_profile` !



The code will stop working work if/when the websites significantly change their layout.
